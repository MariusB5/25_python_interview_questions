# 25 Python Interview Questions

**1. What is Python? What are the advantages of using Python?**

```Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.```

**2. What is a dynamically typed programming language?**

```In dynamically typed programming languages, type checking is performed at runtime. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing and also that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.```

Examples: ```Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua```

**3. What is an interpreted programming language?**

```An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program.```

Examples: ```JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC```

**4. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?**

```PEP 8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.```

**5. What is Scope in Python?**

```A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope. A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function. A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.```

**6. What are lists, tuples and sets? What is the key difference between them?**

```Lists, tuples and sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. List is a collection which is ordered and changeable; allows duplicate members. Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable; allows duplicate members. Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members. *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.```

**13. What is ```break```, ```continue``` and ```pass``` in Python?**

```the_answer```

**14. What are unit tests in Python?**

```the_answer```

**15. What is docstring in Python?**

```the_answer```

**16. What is slicing in Python?**

```the_answer```

**17. What is the difference between Python arrays and lists?**

```the_answer```

**18. How is memory managed in Python?**

```the_answer```

**19. What are Python namespaces? Why are they used?**

```the_answer```

**20. What is Scope Resolution in Python?**

```the_answer```

**21. What are decorators in Python?**

```the_answer```

**22. What are Dict and List comprehensions?**

```the_answer```

**23. What is the ```lambda``` function? Why is it used?**

```the_answer```

**24. How do you copy and object in Python?**

```the_answer```

**25. What is the difference between ```xrange``` and ```range``` in Python?**

```the_answer```

## More Questions

**What is a statically typed programming language?**

```In statically typed languages, type checking is performed during compile time. It means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. Variables generally are not allowed to change types. For some languages, the programmer must specify what type each variable is, other languages offer some form of type inference.```

Examples: ```C, C++, Java, Scala, Haskell```

**What is an compiled programming language?**

```A compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans.```

Examples: ```C, C++, C#, COBOL, Java```

**What is the difference between a high-level and a low-level programming language?**

```The main difference between high-level language and low-level language is that, Programmers can easily understand or interpret or compile the high level language in comparison of machine. On the other hand, Machine can easily understand the low level language in comparison of human beings.```

High-level: ```Python, Java, C#, JavaScript```

Low-level: ```Rust, Fortran, x86 Assembly, COBOL```

```In the old days, C was considered a high-level language. Nowadays C and C++ are considered low-level languages because they have no automatic memory management.```
