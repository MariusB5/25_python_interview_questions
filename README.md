# 25 Python Interview Questions

**1. What is Python? What are the advantages of using Python?**

Answer:

```Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.```

**2. What is a dynamically typed programming language?**

Answer:

```In dynamically typed programming languages, type checking is performed at runtime. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing and also that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.```

Examples: ```Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua```

**3. What is an interpreted programming language?**

Answer:

```An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program.```

Examples: ```JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC```

## More Questions:

**What is a statically typed programming language?**

Answer:

```In statically typed languages, type checking is performed during compile time. It means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. Variables generally are not allowed to change types. For some languages, the programmer must specify what type each variable is, other languages offer some form of type inference. ```

Examples: ```C, C++, Java, Scala, Haskell```

**What is an compiled programming language?**

Answer:

```A compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans.```

Examples: ```C, C++, C#, COBOL, Java```

**What is a high-level programming language?**

Answer:

``` ```

Examples: ```example1, example2```

**What is a low-level programming language?**

Answer:

``` ```

Examples: ```example1, example2```
